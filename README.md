# 🎬 Movie Rental Data Warehouse

## 📖 Overview
This project focuses on designing and building a **Hybrid Data Warehouse Model** for a Movie Rental business using an existing OLTP database schema.

The original OLTP database handles daily operations such as:
- Customer management
- Film inventory
- Rentals and payments
- Store and staff operations

Since OLTP systems are not optimized for analytics, this project transforms operational data into a data warehouse structure that supports reporting and business analysis.

# 🎯 Project Objectives
- Analyze the Movie Rental OLTP schema
- Design a **Hybrid Dimensional Model**
- Build ETL pipelines using Python
- Create analytical structures for reporting and insights

# 🏗️ Data Warehouse Design

The project uses a **Hybrid Schema Design** combining:
- Star Schema concepts
- Snowflake Schema normalization where needed

### 📊 Fact Tables
- `fact_rental_film`
- `fact_rental_customer`
- `fact_payment`

### 🧩 Dimension Tables
